			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<br>

				<!-- Bio -->
				<p id="bio">I was raised in Oakland, CA, and graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BA in American Studies and Minor in Film and Digital Media. While working for a County Supervisor in the Bay Area I managed his social media presence, website, and created content for the his YouTube page. I moved to Southern California where I earned my Masters in Teaching from USC. 
				<br><br>
				I am currently a 7th and 8th grade math teacher and a member of the Multicultural Leadership Team, Math Task Force, and a faculty representative on the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Once a year, I teach an elective that shows students how to add light saber effects to their choreographed fight scenes.
				<br><br>
				I also love to explore the amazing food found in Los Angeles with family and friends. On the weekends, my wife and I spend lots of quality time with our 4 year-old Corgi, Lucy and her new puppy, Riley.</p>
